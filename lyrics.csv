Eminem#Rap God#"Rap God Lyrics
""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
You might also like
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed"#rap#https://genius.com/Eminem-rap-god-lyrics

Whores in this house
There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house (Hol' up)
I said certified freak, seven days a week
Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak, woo (Ah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)

Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yeah, yeah)

Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo

Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's some wet-ass pussy
Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet-ass pussy, huh

There's some whores in this house

Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, lil’, hol’ up, lil' bitch)

Who that nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still I take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy

Astro, yeah
Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know, winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young La Flame, he in sicko mode

(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Some-Some-Some-Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose

Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, ""Come on over!""
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
You might also like
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore820Embed"#rap#https://genius.com/Logic-1-800-273-8255-lyrics

It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves

And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose

Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')

Remy Boyz, yah-ah
1738, ayy

I'm like ""Hey, what's up? Hello"" (Ayy)
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in the door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
At 56 a gram, 5 a hundred grams though
Man, I swear I love her, how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be lettin' bands go
Everybody hatin', we just call them fans, though
In love with the money, I ain't never lettin' go
And I get high with my baby (My baby)
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies

I'm like, ""Hey, what's up? Hello""
I hit the strip with my trap queen, 'cause all we know is bands
I just might snatch up a 'Rari and buy my boo a Lamb'
I just might snatch her a necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't wantin' for nothin' because I got her everything
It's big ZooWap from the bando
Remind me where I can't go
Remy Boyz got the stamp though
Count up hella them bands though
Boy how far can your bands go?
Fetty Wap, I'm livin' 50 thousand K how I stand though
If you checkin' for my pockets I'm like…

And I get high with my baby (My baby)
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeah

Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

Kendrick Lamar#​m.A.A.d city#"​m.A.A.d city Lyrics
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck!""
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!—

Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?

You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?

You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport

Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else

Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?

Be a good girl, you was in the zone

I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty—

I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
