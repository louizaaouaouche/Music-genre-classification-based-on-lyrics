> TEAM MEMBERS : Farah JABRI, Yassine BENBIHI, Louiza AOUAOUCHE & Tristan PERROT

This project called "Music genre classification based on lyrics" has been realized only in an academic context by students of Télécom Paris.

This folder is composed by:
* Scrapping:
  * geniusScrapping.py : file containing the scrapping method code used through Genius website.
* lyrics.csv : resulting csv file from the scrapping : it contains all the lyrics we used   
* notebook.ipynb : contains all the process from data cleaning to the modeling results. 

Warning : some of libraries have to be installed before launching the notebook (e.g langdetect, nltk)
